                </div>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                        I am a Software Engineer and a recent graduate from Purdue’s Computer Science program where I developed a broad range in skills in designing and developing software applications. I am actively looking to find a full-time Software Developing/Engineering position at a Software Company.  I have the skills, values, and desire to contribute from Day One. 
                        <br></br>
                        Programming wasn’t always easy for me. In fact, I received a C+ in the first CS course I ever took. But something about that class felt different than all the other ones. Unlike other courses, programming demanded a deeper understanding of the topics at hand, and those topics and theories really stuck with me unlike the memorization and “plug and chug” that I had previously experienced. Programming gave me a sense of purpose that other subjects were unable to. That is why I decided to switch to a degree in Computer Science during the late semester in my Sophomore year. It was a hard decision to make, as I had to work incredibly hard to still graduate in four years.
                        <br></br>
                        When I set out to become a first-rate programmer, I knew it would be difficult, but at the time, I didn’t understand the kind of commitment and work ethic such an endeavor required. After long nights fueled with caffeine and numerous impending deadlines, I can’t say that I have achieved my goal yet; but what I can say is that I have the utter and total confidence that I can. 
                        <br></br>
                        During that time, I not only learned how to program, but I learned how much grit and tenacity I had and how far I could go to achieve my goal. I learned what it took to get the job done. 
                        I am very proud of where I am today, and even though I would have done things a little differently if I had the chance (such as begin my freshman year majoring in Computer Science), the lessons I learned were invaluable. 
                        <br></br>
                        Perhaps my stubbornness is one of my greatest weaknesses, but without a doubt it is also my greatest strength. I will not rest until each bug is solved and I will not be satisfied until I have followed through with everything until the very end. No matter what obstacle I am presented, I will always land back on my feet.
                        <br></br>
                        I am inspired by what I’ve accomplished so far and aspire to put my passion for programming work in the next chapter; working for a company that is always making <em>greater</em> even <em>better</em>.

Automated a method to solve transitivity problems for the testing of a new survey model for curating customer choices. Researcher's at Purdue were interested in testing whether a new model led survey takers to make lest contradicting decisions. After developing, and applying my algorithm written in Python using undirected graphs, researchers were able to efficiently and accurately see how much survey takers were making contradicting choices. This eliminated human error from the testing process and validated a thesis in economics choice theory.

                    <p id="Yen">"Addison is a positive and truly capable IT professional. I worked with him closely as the technical lead/coordinator on a team of computer science techs, working on a project with a mission to ‘automate the virtual workbench.’ The project was the development of a front-end interface and back-end support capable of serving as a workflow manager for processing and visualizing chemically relevant topological data input (multiple 3rd party file formats), data transformation (molecular system fragmentation and interfacing with 3rd party library APIs), and data storage (cloud-based server and SQL database). During our time on the project, Addison demonstrated himself beyond proficient as a software developer when dealing with our large and not-well documented legacy code base written in a combination of Java, C, MySQL and python. iSpiEFP has a substantial code base and has gone through at least 4 iterations. Addison was the spearhead for many of them and as such is the main code contributor. Aside from being an exceptional IT lead on our team, Addison was a blast to work with! His demeanor was always positive – even when it seemed our obstacles were impossible to overcome (but we overcame them!) and as such served as a valuable team-player. I am STRONGLY recommending Addison to ANY organization who is considering him for a position. If more information is needed, please feel free to message me directly and I will be happy to further expand upon my recommendation."</p>

                    <p id="Slipchenko">"It is rare to see such a self-sufficient programmer like Addison with an aptitude to recognize specific requirements of a scientific software development in a drastically different field such as computational chemistry.  Addison joined my research group during a transitional period when previous developers were leaving, while the legacy code was of scarce documentation. After studying the code base, Addison was able to restructure the code and contribute new features following the discussions with chemistry students. Not only did he end up touching about every part of our code base, backend and frontend, but he also led the project to its first working internal release. Additionally, he secured the project by moving it to version control and created numerous forms of documentation along the way. By advertising the project among fellow students, he ensured a smooth transition to the next generation of the developers when he decided to part with the project. He is an amazing person and programmer! I am looking forward to hearing what he does next!"</p>
